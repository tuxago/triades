  **The Challenge**
  Emmanuelle, a home organizing consultant, needed a website for her business. She had a limited budget and didn't know how to make a website herself.
  
  **The Solution**
  Shani suggested an online website builder that was very easy to use. She then helped Emmanuelle define her brand, find words that would resonate with her audience, and put all of this on the website.
  
  **What Happened**
  In 3 sessions with Shani, Emmanuelle was able to completely redefine her communication strategy and the way she presents her services. She now has a professional website that reflects the simplicity and zen attitude she brings to home organizing, a site she can maintain herself.
  
  **Testimonial**
  Shani's sense of culture and personality take you straight to the heart of your communication. She helps you clearly define what makes you unique, and in doing so, hones in on who your client is.  Her communication style is simple, clean, and efficient, which works well with my business based on simplicity and authenticity. It was a real pleasure to work with Shani in building my website. Her intuition and understanding of the project allowed me to consolidate my communication strategy.Â»
